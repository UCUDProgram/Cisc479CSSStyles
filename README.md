# Cisc479CSSStyles
Project 3

This project was an assignment for a University of Delaware class,
CISC 467 - Intro to Client-Side Engineering

This assignment called for altering the appearance of a website's appearance to create a theme

The theme that i chose was one of randomness.  This theme is based on assigning random css styles instead of having a specific element associated with a specific css class to unite elements.
In assigning the randomness, i broke down the assignment into two categories: element and css style
The element category refers to the type of tag in the document. For example, div, h1-h6 and strong
The css style refers to the style that will be applied to that element
  The styles were broken into 7 categories: variants(bold, italic, underline), fontsize, textcolor, text alignment, font style, letter spacing and borders.
  Each element would have a random style from each of these style categories.

The body of the website (website page) has a click listener attached to change the page to a different random visual appearance on a mouse click.
